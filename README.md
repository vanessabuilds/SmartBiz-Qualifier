# SmartBiz-Qualifier
💡 Inspiration
Sales is tough—especially for entrepreneurs trying to identify which leads are worth the time. Having experienced this firsthand, I wanted to build a tool that takes the guesswork out of lead qualification. SmartBiz-Qualifier is designed to help sales teams focus on the most promising leads by automating and optimizing the qualification process using AI.

Key features include:

🧠 AI-driven lead scoring

📊 Predictive analysis based on lead attributes
